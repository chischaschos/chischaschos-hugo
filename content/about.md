# What I’m doing now
I am **Emmanuel Delgado**, currently living in San Francisco, US. I am
investing my time in:

- Developing Software in [ModCloth](http://www.modcloth.com/)
- Training [BJJ](http://ralphgracie.com).
- [Reading](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/24112838-emmanuel-delgado)

If my activities change, I’ll update this page. Last update was in February 2016.

> CREDIT: I stole the idea for this page from [Gregory Brown](http://practicingdeveloper.com/now/) and  [Derek Sivers](https://sivers.org/nowff).
