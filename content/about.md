# What I’m doing now
I am **Emmanuel Delgado**, currently living in San Francisco, US. I am
investing my time in:

- Developing Software in [Juvo](https://juvo.com/)

If my activities change, I’ll update this page. Last update was in April 2018.

> CREDIT: I stole the idea for this page from [Gregory Brown](http://practicingdeveloper.com/now/) and  [Derek Sivers](https://sivers.org/nowff).
