# What I’m doing now
Hi, I'm Emmanuel Delgado. I'm in Colima, Mexico, spending all my time on these things:

- Consulting at [Magma Labs](http://www.magmalabs.io/).
- Learning about Graphs in [Coursera's Advanced Data Structures](https://www.coursera.org/learn/advanced-data-structures).
- Preparing a podcast with my friends in [La Developeria](developeria.io), hopefully to be launched before end of February 2016.
- Training Jiu Jitsu at [Zapata Team Colima](https://www.facebook.com/VolcanoBJJ).

If my activities change, I’ll update this page. Last update was in February 2016.

> CREDIT: I stole the idea for this page from [Gregory Brown](http://practicingdeveloper.com/now/) and  [Derek Sivers](https://sivers.org/nowff).
