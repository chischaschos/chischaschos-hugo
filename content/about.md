# What I’m doing now
I am **J. Emmanuel Enrique Delgado Lara**, currently living in South San Francisco, US. I am
investing my time in:

- Developing Software in [ModCloth](http://www.modcloth.com/)
- Training [BJJ](ralphgracie.com).

## What I was doing on February 2016

- Consulting at [Magma Labs](http://www.magmalabs.io/).
- Learning about Graphs in [Coursera's Advanced Data Structures](https://www.coursera.org/learn/advanced-data-structures).
- Preparing a podcast with my friends in [La Developeria](developeria.io), hopefully to be launched before end of February 2016.
- Training Jiu Jitsu at [Zapata Team Colima](https://www.facebook.com/VolcanoBJJ).

If my activities change, I’ll update this page. Last update was in February 2016.
