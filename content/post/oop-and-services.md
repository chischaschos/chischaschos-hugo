## Motivation
- What is a service?
- Who defines it?
- What contexts can services live in?
- Services best practices around naming and design.

### Eric Evan's Domain driven design
[Service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design), when an operation does not conceptually belong to any object. Following the natural contours of the problem, you can implement these operations in services. See also Service (systems architecture).

### Martin Fowler
[The Service Layer](https://martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/serviceLayer.html), defines an application's boundary with a layer of services that establishes a set of available operations and **coordinates the application's response in each operation**.
